# About Me:

Application Security professional with 2+ years in software dev and ~11 months in AppSec. I focus on automation and consistency: generating reports from existing team scanners (SAST/SCA), using Semgrep with community rules, and supporting teams with Threat Modeling and DAST (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite).

Iâ€™m growing toward secure SDLC integration (pipelines, custom rules, metrics) and deeper API/AuthZ work. Also exploring bug bounty (IDOR/logic) to hone real-world skills.
